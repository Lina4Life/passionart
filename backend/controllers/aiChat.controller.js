Work light to dark, embrace the paper's texture.\n\n• **Brushwork**: Vary pressure, angle, and speed for different marks\n• **Color temperature mixing**: Cool shadows, warm lights create dimension\n• **Texture techniques**: Dry brush, scumbling, glazing add surface interest\n\nWhat traditional medium are you working with?";
